      <h3>The Perfect Sandwich, A Real NYC Classic</h3>
      <p>How to make your favorite sandwich Sandwiches are made all over the world, and can be made in so many different ways. Of course, some people think of sandwiches differently. The name Sandwich originally came from a man by the name of Lord Sandwich. Lord Sandwich was a gambling man, and he would be given bread and meat to eat during his gambling time at the table. The original sandwich was actually just a piece of salt beef between two pieces of bread that was toasted. We have a term for people who do not eat meat, bread, or other types of food, called “Vegans”. They might make sandwiches only using vegetables, because they don’t want to eat a regular sandwich, but still want to get the same feeling.</p>

      <h3>Let Me Tell You About This Steak</h3>
      
      <p>'Nutritionally, a little saturated fat, like that found in beef, is fine. (Beef contains over 40% monounsaturated fat anyway).  You just don’t want too much of it, so trim the extra fat after cooking if you’re trying to cut back.  Also, instead of going for a leaner cut, you can always just eat a smaller portion of a better tasting one.<br>So don’t be afraid of the fat; in fact, for a perfect steak with very little marinating, you need a cut with a little fat. Personally, I’ve found the ribeye to be the perfect cut for a great, easy-to-prepare steak.</p>

      <h3>Cherries</h3>
      <p>Cherries are small, round fruits that can be sweet or sour. They grow on trees that are also known for their flowers. Cherry trees grow throughout the world, in areas that do not get extreme heat or cold.<br>Different types of cherry tree produce sweet cherries and sour cherries. Sweet-cherry trees are large, reaching heights up to 36 feet (11 meters). Their fruit is usually round or heart-shaped. Sweet cherries vary in color from yellow to red to nearly black. People eat sweet cherries fresh or canned.<br>Sour-cherry trees are smaller than sweet-cherry trees. They are usually less than 16 feet (5 meters) tall. Sour cherries are round and smaller than sweet cherries. They are usually dark red. Sour cherries are not eaten fresh because of their sour taste. They are frozen or canned and used in sauces and pastries, such as cherry pie.<br>Some kinds of cherry tree do not bear fruit. But people like these trees for the beautiful pink and white flowers they bear. Many cherry trees are planted in gardens and parks, especially in Japan.<br>The wood of cherry trees is valued for its rich red color. People use cherry wood to make cabinets, furniture, and other products.</p>

      <h3>All I Need Is a Popsicle</h3>
      <p>The frozen pop has its origins in frozen desserts that are as old as civilization. The ancient Romans had blocks of ice carried down from the mountains in the summer. The blocks were ground into crushed ice that was flavored with fruit and syrup. The Chinese are credited with the same practice, and these sherbets, sorbets, and frozen ices were served in the thirteenth century court of Kublai Khan (1215-1294) when the Italian adventurer Marco Polo (1254-1324) visited. Other ancient cultures including those of Turkey, Persia (now Iran), the Arabian Peninsula, and India also knew of frozen, flavored ices. They were usually a privilege of the wealthy and were made of ice, fruit pulp, fruit syrup, and flowers for flavor, fragrance, and color. Frozen treats were served to honor guests at banquets or to cleanse the palate between courses, as sorbets are still used today</p>

      <h3>Salmon For Your Skin</h3>
      <p>Salmon skin is usually considered safe to eat. The skin contains more of the same minerals and nutrients contained in salmon, which may be an excellent addition to any diet.<br>There are some things to consider when choosing whether to eat the salmon skin, such as the source and quality of the fish. Personal preference may also play a role when deciding whether to eat the salmon skin or not.</p>

      <h3>Croissant</h3>
      <p>Vidhi Yadav c*utiya bhen k* lod* When you think about a fresh, flaky croissant, you probably conjure up images of Paris. A lazy morning on the Left Bank, a small round table, reading Le Journal with a steamy cup of café au lait, and of course, that croissant. That warm, buttery croissant. Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Enjoyable on all sides and in every way imaginable.<br>Now, ask yourself where it’s from. Go deep. Go beyond the simple answer of “the little bakery around the corner” and search for the origin, the true birthplace of that oh-so-famous French delicacy.<br>We’re sorry to do this to you, but we’re going to get right to it.</p>
